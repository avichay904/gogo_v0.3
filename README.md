# Courier Management System - README

## Project Overview:

This project tackles logistical challenges faced by courier agents, offering a comprehensive solution through  ASP.NET technologies.

## Usage Instructions:

1. **Google Maps API Key:**
   - Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis) to create an API key for Places, Directions, Maps, and JavaScript services.
   - Insert the obtained API key in the following locations:
     - `gogo_v0.3/Administrator/WebForm1.aspx`
     - `gogo_v0.3/Administrator/AddShipments.aspx`
     - `gogo_v0.3/Administrator/CreateRoute.aspx.cs`


2. **Project Components:**
   - SQL is used for robust data management.
   - ASP.NET is employed for creating dynamic web applications.
   - Key folder structure:
     - `APP_CODE` is divided into `BLL` (Business Logic Layer) and `DLL` (Data Logic Layer).
     - `DLL` manages all database queries.
     - `BLL` and `Services` (in `APP_CODE`) provide auxiliary functions.
     - `DBContext` class communicates with the database.
     - All pages are in the `Administrator` directory.

3. **Getting Started:**
   - Clone the repository.
   - Set up the required API key as mentioned above.
   - Ensure the correct folder structure and configurations.
   - Run the application using ASP.NET.

4. **Note:**
   - Make sure the API key is correctly inserted for seamless integration with Google Maps services.
   - Adjust configurations in `APP_CODE` as needed.
